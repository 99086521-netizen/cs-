                <h3>School Achievements</h3>
                <p>Coming into highschool, I was given more oppurtunities in which classes to take. Trying to take advantage of these oppurtunities, I entered two AP's, AP BIO and AP Computer Science Principles. Taking these classes pushed me to try work harder and learn how to take on a more rigourous schedule. By the end of the semester, despite it's challenges, I perservered and ended my semester with all A's in each class.</p>
                <h3>Sports Achievements</h3>
                <p>Starting off my sports journey at the age of nine with volleyball.<br>I continued my passion for the sport entering my school's frosh girl's team and learned to balance sports with school.</p>
